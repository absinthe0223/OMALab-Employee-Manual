# General Guidelines & Strategies {#general-guidelines--strategies}

Advice from ourselves to ourselves for when we forget.

## Build "Collective Knowledge" {#slow-down-to-speed-up}

As a team, especially one that is remote, we have to work hard to maintain and grow "Collective Knowledge", aka that more than 1 person knows how to do things. To this end, we work together with people in areas doing multiple jobs--we are all generalists. This allows and empowers us to spread the knowledge of how things work.  In this same concept, if you are the first person working on a task, you should document how this section works in the WIki. That way, people can read it, and understand how an area works when they pick it up to work on it.

## Slow down to speed up {#slow-down-to-speed-up}

You can't sustain a sprint through a marathon. Remember the tortoise. When in doubt, use [the Eisenhower box](http://jamesclear.com/eisenhower-box).

## Hold strong opinions lightly {#hold-strong-opinions-lightly}

Respect, love, and nurture your own and others' opinions. Recognize that they are just that—opinions—and are thus vulnerable to fallacy. Nobody ever learned anything through radical stubbornness of opinion. That's the opposite of learning. Embrace not-knowing, and don't confuse confidence with certainty.

Stay true to your confidence, and seek to clarify its origin. If you give up on your tension, you will disengage from your work and rob the company of the information embedded in it.

Even as you stay true and firm to your conviction, stay loose and flexible with the proposed solution. There are many ways to resolve the tension between problem and solution and opinions and alternatives.

## Run experiments, not debates {#run-experiments-not-debates}

Inquiry and proof are valuable, healthy, and actionable. Unfounded arguments protect our egos \(temporarily\) but are utterly useless and unhealthy for learning and growth. If you find yourself in a circular debate, get on the same side to figure out what experiment needs to be run to resolve the disagreement. Stay true to questions, not answers.

## Save yourself, not the world {#save-yourself-not-the-world}

It's easy to feel like because we are consulting and educating our customers that we need to pretend to be purely selfless and altruistic. That "we're here to help". Bring your personal purpose, needs, and agenda to the table. It's more honest.

### Identify Your 4 Percent {#identify-your-4-percent}

The net of this best practice is this: The 80/20 rule \(Pareto's principle\) applies to your work \(80% of the results come from 20% of the work\). But, if you apply the Pareto principle to Pareto's principle, the result is that 64% of the benefit comes from just 4% of the work.

The key idea here is that it's important to identify your 4%. With a good analysis of what you think your 4% is, you can spend much more time on things that will produce results. This idea fundamentally is the idea of "LEVERAGE". If you do work, and it moves us sideways, you are trading dollars.

## Play harmonies, not solos {#play-harmonies-not-solos}

Working with a team involves an implicit \(and hopefully, explicit\) commitment to each other as much as to the work at hand. Collaboration means that we prioritize collective synchrony over individual achievement. Don't abandon your team.

> "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together" ~African Proverb

## Seek to clarify, not to control {#seek-to-clarify-not-to-control}

When reality is not aligned with how you wish it to be, clarify the dissonance for others instead of demanding that it be fixed. Our ideal reality is not always shared by others; to move together we must first agree on where and what the dissonances are.

Autonomy only works if we choose to communicate over command. In a cooperative environment, we lead with clarity.

> “Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own.” ~ Donella Meadows

## Serve with humility {#serve-with-humility}

OMALab will not single-handedly save the world. We are, ultimately, not that important. Act accordingly.
