## Conduct Policy

This Code of Conduct applies to community members and OMAlab/Audienti in all Audienti communities online \(including but not limited to IRC, support chat, the Audienti/GrowthChat/Growmance Slack, Twitter, and Facebook\), in the Audienti office, and at all events hosted by Audienti.

Our team is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or computing experience \(or lack of any of the aforementioned\).

We do not tolerate harassment of team members in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

**Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.**

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Team members violating these rules may be sanctioned or removed from team spaces. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please issue a complaint via our [Complaint Policy](/chapter1/general-policies/complaints.md).
