# The OMALab Guide {#the-guide}

Welcome to OMALab, Inc. doing business as Audienti.

At OMALab we are working to build a purpose-driven organization. That’s an easy thing to want and say, but it’s difficult to practice. It takes active effort to articulate our guiding principles and values, and to express them day to day.

This repository contains all our agreements, policies, operating models, values and guiding principles. It is meant to be living and dynamic support for working how we work. It’s not perfect, but we think it’s an exciting place to begin.

As a small company, this document will change. We reserve the right to amend, revise and/or withdraw parts of it.

All feedback and suggestions \(in the form of pull requests\) are appreciated. This is a work in progress we hope will get better with more time and more contributors.

Each team member must read, understand, and comply with this guide. Our goal is to work together towards a work environment that is constructive and supports both personal and professional growth.

_**This document is subject to change without prior notice.**_

### MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO REVIEW {#most-important-things-to-review}

While we attempt to get you to sign and accept the Guide as a guidebook for our working relationship--sometimes it is difficult to get these documents back. Given this, you understand and acknowledge that by receiving a payment from OMALab, Inc. you are accepting the terms of this guidebook in its entirety, in all current and future versions.

Specifically, we strongly suggest you review the following contractual documents:

* [Acknowledgement of Receipt and Acceptance](/Acknowledgement of Receipt and Acceptance of Your Guide)
  * This is the document we request you sign and send back. If you don't, then accepting and depositing any payment from OMAlab, Inc. is considered acceptance of this agreement.
* [Confidential Information, Invention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement](/Confidentiality Agreement)
  * This document is your actual employment agreement. It defines standard terms for your employment or contract. It also handles assignment of intellectual property created while being paid by OMALab, Inc.
* [At-Will Employment](/chapter1/at-will-employment.md)
  * Your employment is ultimately At-Will. This is a legal term. Please review this.

  * Getting a bonus or an MBO? Then you should review this document.

  Most of this is covered in the Confidential information agreement. But, for the sake of completeness, we defined the terms of this again.
