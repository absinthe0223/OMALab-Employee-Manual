# Hourly-Paid Contractor Work Policy \(International\)

> These policies apply if:
>
> * You are paid hourly
> * You are outside of the United States of America

These policies do not apply to hourly employees in the United States, which have laws and regulations related to hourly work.

You agree that if you are not inside of the United States, these policies apply to you,

You agree that your hourly wages are based on how productive you are, not for the hours you choose to bill us.

##### Not To Exceed Limit

You agree that your hours will be managed with a Not to Exceed \(NTE\) amount. This means that once you hit this cap, incremental work will not result in more payment.

If your Not to Exceed \(NTE\) is not explicitly set in a written agreement between you and the CEO, your billed work MUST not exceed 35 hours of your base rate per week, or 147 hours of your base rate monthly \(35 hours/week \* 4.2 weeks in a month\).

**Billing hours to OMALab does NOT guarantee your payment for these hours**

Your billing through our systems \(Time Doctor/Hubstaff/Upwork\) does NOT guarantee you a full payment.  OMAlab expects that you will produce at a level identified by  your professional level and billing rate. If you do not perform that this level \(quality, speed, results\), then you will not be paid for these hours. Please see the remote work section for additional details about professional levels.

**Policies in this guide MUST be followed to receive full compensation**

OMAlab expects that you will follow our policies and procedures that enable us to track your productivity. Any non-adherence to company policies will result in reduced or deferred compensation, or non-payment for services. In particular, please review the section on Remote Work for several policies that must be followed.
