## Contractor/Upwork Rules for Engagement

This section defines our expectations for contractors that are working with us through Upwork or other freelancer-type site. If you do not follow these rules, you will likely be terminated and replaced.  

**We expect professional work.** If you are hired to perform a job, we expect high quality, professional grade work. In most activities we outsource, we have internal personnel that could do the job in a professional way. Therefore, if you took the job thinking that you could do the work quickly, or sloppy, then please just let us know and let's terminate the relationship amicably. 

**We expect YOU, the person we hired, to do the work. **There is MANY cases where we try to hire top, higher cost, talent. We have had a number of cases where the person then turns around and hires a less experienced, cheaper person, to do the work. This is 100% unacceptable.  If we hired you to do the work, then we expect you do to the work.

**We expect you to hit your estimate/budgeted hours.** We will ask, and if we don't, you should demand that you provide us with an estimate of the work you are going to perform--how many hours it will take. We then, expect you to deliver the product within this estimate.  If you don't give us an estimate, then we will default to expecting you to complete the task within 1 hour.  

**We expect you to revise your estimate/budget if something changes. ** Sometimes, things happen that keep us from hitting that estimate. As soon as you know that you will not hit that estimate/budget, you are required to let us know. And, as soon as possible, you are required to give us a revised estimate. 

**We also expect things to be delivered on time, on CALENDAR time**. If you say things will be done on next Monday, then we expect you to be done on next Monday. LIke your estimate for the number of hours the task will take, we expect you to hit your timelines on the calendar.

**We expect you to tell us a calendar time when things will be complete or ready for test.** If you don't provide a calendar day/time of day when you will be complete, we will assume you are working 7 hours a day, starting from the hiring point. This means that if you are doing a 10 hour job, and you start on Monday night, we expect it will be done Wednesday morning. 

**We expect YOU to ask for information/drive through blocks, to get the job complete.** If you are waiting on US for information, we expect you to be driving us to get an answer so you can complete the job. It's NEVER an acceptable answer that we have been waiting on your task for several days, only to have you tell us you were waiting on us. It is YOUR responsibility to nag us to get your answers so you can get your job done, on budget and on time. 

**We expect you to deliver a daily update at the end of the day, when you've worked for us.** This daily update should answer 3 or 4 questions: 

1. What did you complete today? 
2. What will you complete tomorrow?
3. What is blocking you?
4. What is your current estimate for your job/task to be complete? \(any revisions to your planned calendar\). 

**We expect you to make yourself available to answer questions using US working hours**. We have a responsiblity to our customers and have to answer questions. It's expected that you will be available to answer questions so we can get answers back to the client promptly. If you will not be able to answer questions within 30 minutes of being asked during normal US working hours, or you will be away from the computer, then you are required to give us a phone number or other way of reaching you to get questions answered.
