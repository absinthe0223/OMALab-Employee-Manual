# Operating Model

Through intense commitment to our employees, we will contribute to the success of our customers. The consequence of having loyal, smart, hardworking, long-term, and well-compensated employees is superb quality service to customers.

Our business is complex, with human, mechanical, and computer systems in simultaneous motion. Success depends on refined communication and organizational systems, dedicated staff, documented procedures, first-class tools, rigorous quality control with continuous measurement, assertive innovation, intensive systems maintenance and improvements, aggressive and measured marketing, and relentless attention to detail throughout the organization.

These operational models provide us competitive advantages:

* Custom-developed tools that simplify our work and make it measurable, products that are designed for the unique needs of our customers,

* Thoughtful customer service that is immediate and consistent, and

* Absolute personal/corporate integrity.

To do this, we use extraordinarily efficient communication tools and protocols. We constantly refine and improve all internal systems to improve ourselves every time we deliver.

To grow, we focus on two things. First, we build "great" products. Second, we aggressively market them. Rapid growth comes from aggressive growth of our customer base. And, we develop deep expertise in the areas our customer's marketing."Our operational framework is rigid, but that framework can be modified instantly."We segment responsibilities into specialized "roles" with appropriate cross-training among departments. We have backup personnel for all management and staff positions.
