# Getting Things Done

Getting Things Done, commonly referred to as GTD, is an approach to productivity that was developed by David Allen. It was documented in the form of the [Getting Things Done](http://amzn.com/B00KWG9M2E) book which was first published in 2001.

The first thing you need to do is watch our[GTD Overview Video](https://shereef.wistia.com/medias/0me7x7hd71)

The key GTD concepts are as follows:

* **Keep things out of your head - **The mind is a great place to have thoughts, but a lousy place to store them - especially in this modern day and age.
* **Decide actions and outcomes as things show up on your radar, not later - **Said another way, deal with things when they show up, not when they blow up.
* **Regularly review and update the complete inventory of open loops in your life and work -** If your psyche knows that you will review what you’ve externalized regularly, it can relax and will stop interrupting at inopportune times — for example when you’re trying to sleep.

### MaintainingandRegainingControl

DavidAllenidentifiedfivethingsthatmustbedoneregularlytomaintaincontrol,ortoregaincontrol:

* **Capture**
  **\(Collect\)**
  — Collect everything that has your attention and isn’t already on cruise control. This includes gathering items into an inbox and making lists.
* **Clarify**
  **\(Process\)**
  — Take items that you’ve collected and determine what significance they have, if any, and what action\(s\), if any, needs to be taken.
* **Organize**
  — Organize the results in a form that you can easily access them when needed.
* **Reflect**
  **\(Review\)**
  — It’s important to perform regular reviews to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.
* **Engage**
  **\(Do\)**
  — Choose and engage in actions.

### CaptureTools

It’s important to have convenient ways of collecting “stuff” that has come into your world that isn’t on cruise control. This stuff can include things like thoughts, pieces of paper and e-mails. It’s not necessary to make any decision about what this stuff means at this stage in the process, but if something obviously has no value \(e.g. some junk mail that arrived in your inbox\) then you might as well get rid of it right away.  
Some common collection tools include:

* **Physical**
  **In-basket**
  — It is recommended that you have at least one physical inbox for each location \(e.g. work and home\) that is processed regularly.
* **Notebook**
  — Sometimes it’s most convenient to capture things on paper. Unless you’re keeping a log or journal, opt for a notebook with tear off pages so that you can easily put what you’ve captured into your in-basket or scanner.
* **Computer**
  —If you’re often in front of your computer, it will likely makes sense to capture some items directly into your computer.
* **iPhone,**
  **iPad,**
  **Android,**
  **Blackberry,**
  **etc.**
  — Mobile devices can also provide a very convenient way to capture pretty much anything that has your attention.
* **Voice**
  **Recorder**
  — People who are on the road a lot often find it useful to capture voice notes. These notes are later transcribed for processing.
* **Digital**
  **Camera**
  — Taking a picture of something can be an efficient way to capture information.

#### Other“Inboxes”

Therearenumerouswaysinwhichwecollectinformationand,inthismoderntechnologicalera,manywaysinwhichstuffcomesintoourlives.It’simportanttoidentifyallofthesourcesofincominginformationsothatyoucanensurethatthesesourcesareprocessedregularly.Typicalexamplesinclude:

* **Backpack/Briefcase**
  — Each of these is essentially an inbox. If it isn’t processed regularly then important opportunities could slip through the cracks. Especially if you’re a frequent traveller, it’s recommend that you carry a distinct folder that you deem your mobile inbox.
* **E-mail**
  ---

  — You likely have at least a couple of accounts and may receive a high volume of e- mail. Having a strategy to deal with e-mail is important and is a topic we’ll cover in the second part of the course.
* **Facebook**
  , Twitter, etc. — Social media has given others a range of new ways to get in touch with us.
* **Mailbox**
  —The volume of mail coming into physical mailboxes has diminished for many people in our technological era. But, it still important to have a strategy for dealing with incoming mail.
* **Text**
  **Message**
  — Text messages can provide a convenient alternative to phone calls and e- mails in some situations. They key is to have a strategy to manage this source of information without it becoming an unnecessary distraction.
* **Wallet/Purse**
  — You may accumulate important information \(e.g. business cards\) in your wallet or purse. Emptying these sources regularly will help ensure this input is dealt with in a timely manner.
* **Voicemail**
  — Voicemails can accumulate and can easily be forgotten. It is recommended that you establish a workflow for capturing voicemails. This could be as simple as writing down the information from the voicemail on a piece of paper that is added to your inbox.

* Go through each inbox in order, even though it may be tempting to dig through the list and only deal with “urgent” items. The intention is to
  **be**
  **proactive**
  **rather**
  **than**
  **reactive**
  and developing discipline around processing your inbox encourages a proactive approach.
* Once you take something out of an inbox
  **don’t**
  **put**
  **it**
  **back**
  . Either discard it, keep it for future reference, act on or delegate it right away or put a plan in place to deal with it in the future.

## TheThreeFoldNatureofWork

Whenitcomestowork,considerthatthatthereareonlythreethingsthatyoucouldpossiblybedoing:

* **Doing**
  **Unplanned**
  **Work**
  — This typically comes in the form of interruptions. You respond to a phone call or to an e-mail that arrives in your inbox. Sometimes responding to interruptions is completely appropriate and other times these interruptions inappropriately draw your attention away from what’s most important.
* **Doing**
  **Predefined**
  **Work**
  — You might also be doing work based on planning — specifically work that resulted from processing the “stuff” that came into your life.
* **Defining**
  **Work**
  — Lastly, it’s important to acknowledge that defining work is in itself work. The act of processing and organizing your projects and next actions falls into this category.
