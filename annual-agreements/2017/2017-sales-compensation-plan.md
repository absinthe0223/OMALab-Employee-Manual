## Sales Compensation Plan

### Fiscal Year 2017

#### **Introduction**

The plan defines the terms and conditions under which compensation will be paid for sales activities, including the roles of AVPâ€™s, Sales Directors, Sales Territory/Account Managers, Sales Engineers, as well as others.  It is envisioned that everyone in the company has a variable component to their compensation--dependent on the sales success of the company.

The objective of the plan is to pay sales compensation for securing solid and profitable business on behalf of the company.

This plan also set out the full responsibilities of salespeople from forecasting through to collection.

**Compensation Plan Objectives**

* The plan targets should be achievable
* The plan should be clear and understandable
* The plan should be easy to administer
* The plan should provide an environment that enables team members to excel

#### Sales Targets

##### Revenue Targets

The FY 2017/18 revenue targets for the Sales Organization are as follows:

| Gross Revenue | Net Revenue |
| :--- | :--- |
| $1.6 million | $1.1 million |

#### Commission Calculation

The FY 17/18 plan will pay commission on the Net Revenue \(i.e. gross profit\) of the deal.  This is calculated using a fixed formula that uses the following elements:

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| List Price \(LIST\) | The list price \(retail price\) for the good or service sold |
| Net Sales Price \(NSP\) | The price that the good or service was actually sold at. What price is in the agreement? |
| Cost of Goods Sold Percentage \(COGSP\) | The percentage of the list price that represents the cost of the item being sold \(i.e. the COGS\). |
| Gross Profit \(GP\) | The Net Sales Price \(NSP\) minus the List Price \(LIST\) times the Cost of Goods Sold Percentage \(COGSP\). The Gross Profit on the Deal. |
| Commission Rate \(CR\) | The percentage of the Gross Profit that is payable to you as a commission on the deal. |
| Commission \(C\) | The net payable commission to you for good or service sold. |
| Annual Gross Revenue Target \(AGRT\) | The expected annual gross revenue expected to be collected from your territory. |
| Annual Net Revenue Target \(ANRT\) | The expected annual net revenue expected to be collected from your territory. |
| Quarterly Targets \(QT\) | By quarter, you are expected to achieve a certain percentage of the total expected revenue from your territory. |
| Contract Value | The total agreed upon payments that are defined in a recurring revenue agreement. The customer/client is required to pay this amount over time per the terms of the agreement. |

The formula used for this calculation is: C = CR \* GP.

To simplify and make the calculation easier, OMALab has supplied a Google Spreadsheet that can be used as a calculator for the commissions due on any deal. Please [MAKE A COPY for yourself](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19cUHFYQpfeqMfztrVG2CkwHDsc-JPZCe8fSbrCo9ICM/edit?usp=sharing) before modifying the spreadsheet.

Please note that your commission rates may be different for a Good or a Service, such as Setup Fees, Maintenance and Support Agreements, etc.  However, this calculation methodology will be used for all calculations.

#### Commission Terms

All compensation, ultimately, is at the discretion of the executive compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the company.  They have full discretion in the payout of all commissions and their decision is final.

Individual sales Net & Gross Revenue Targets will be distributed to sales team members based on territory and account responsibility, assessed revenue generation potential, length of time and experience with the company, and management discretion.

These individual sales targets will be discussed with team members individually and will be outlined in your Individual Sales Target and Compensation Plan document.

Individual territory and account coverage will be agreed upon between you and your manager and outlined in your individual sales compensation letter.  Account, Territory Assignments, and other factors may be modified at any time by the executive compensation committee, the CEO, or the VP of Sales.

When you exceed your AGRT and ANRT contract values, you will be paid **120%** of your commission rate on the excess above the ANRT.

The accelerator for achieving quota will only be paid on the remainder of the sales plan term. 

For the purposes of planning, you will be expected to "hit" quarterly revenue targets as a percentage of your Annual targets. Unless defined in your compensation letter, the following quarterly targets apply:

* 20% for Q1
* 45% for Q1 and Q2
* 70% for Q1, Q2, and Q3. 

It is critical for a company to have balanced quarter to quarter revenue growth. If you are far below quarterly revenue targets for any period, this is grounds for termination for poor performance.

Commision is paid in the payroll immediately following the end of the quarter. For example, if Q1 ends on the last day of March, then Q1 commissions will be paid in the last pay period of April.

Each person is ultimately responsible for ensuring the payment of customer invoices. If you receive commission for an invoice and the customer's payment becomes overdue by 60 days, the commission will be deduced from your next commission payment. Commissions will be re-paid when the invoice is paid by the customer.

The company reserves the right to review and modify this payment plan any any individual covered in this plan if an unforseen situation arises that would cause the individual or individuals to be compensated beyond what is reasonable.

#### Commission Recognition

In order for an invoice to be recognized for commission payments, the following standards MUST be achieved:

* a customer who is willing to pay
* a customer that has the funds to pay \(and is willing to do so\) 
* payment terms of Net 30 unless otherwise well defined and agreed in advance
* payment terms that are not predicated by a future \(uncertain\) event, such as doubtful acceptance, an event we can't control, or installation of of a future feature or release
* a signed contract
* a purchase order
* a payment of the invoiced amount
* the customer must have accepted and executed our terms and conditions unmodified

Revenue entered for any given month will be pushed to the following month in the event that the terms of recognition are not met. Modification of the recognition of revenue is at the discretion of the CEO or executive compensation committee, and may be modified at their discretion.

An effort will be made to access the financial viability of the potential customer and their ability to pay. Salespeople, at times, will be asked to provide the business rationale and supporting documentation from the prospective customer in order to access the risk to the company.

Payments of commissions will be made, unless modified by the executive committee on paid invoices by the client or customer.

A salesperson is not allowed to "go negative" in in any quarter. In other words, if the planned phasing of invoices and shipments results in a negative balance in any quarter, then the cost of sales must be accounted for by moving it forward if sufficient invoicing precedes the shipment, or backward if shipping precedes the invoice.

Standard terms are net 30. Terms beyond Net 30 require CEO approval.

Any non-standard terms require CEO approval.

Any deals with the customer is invoiced as a percentage of the total deal based on milestones can be accepted. Please note that in these deal terms, as you are paid commission only on net revenue paid by the customer, milestone-based deal terms delay payments of commissions.

Deals with negative net revenue are STRONGLY discouraged. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any deal with negative net revenue will count as negative toward sales commission payments. These negative numbers must be "made back" before any commissions will be paid.

Generally, once territory or region will be responsible and receive commissions for a deal. However, in some circumstances, more than one salesperson or team may be responsible for a deal, or may substantially assist in closing a deal.  In these situations, either a split of commission is due, or the deal commission might be paid to both groups. The CEO and or the executive compensation committee makes a final determination, and their determination is binding.

#### Trials

An invoice is not required to engage a prospect in a trial. However, should you sign the customer up to a trial, it's understood that the issuing of a trial carries costs that must be carried by the company. Should the salesperson repeatedly offer trials that do not end in a sale, then this will be considered a negative factor in rating the performance of the sales person.

Any trial must include the terms by which the trial is terminated and the deal is accepted by the customer.

A trial must include a fixed duration of time, of no longer than 30 days.

A trial must have a document that shows acknowledgement of the trial terms, and this must be acknowledged by the customer.

The trial terms must include the pricing the customer will pay once accepted by the customer.

#### Maintenance, Setup Fees, and other One Time Charges

Maintenance, setup fees, and other one time charges represent a significant revenue stream for the company, and therefore the company provides an ongoing commission for these items.

The salesperson is responsible for ensuring the correct amount is invoiced for these items.

Like the cost of goods sold, maintenance, setup fees, etc have a separately defined list price and cost of goods sold. These are used for the purposes of commision payments on these items.

#### Forecasting, Annual Plans, and Metric tracking

Sales personnel are required to maintain an accurate forecast of upcoming business by virtue of closeable events in the sales tracking system. Without accurate forecasts, the company cannot guarantee that timely delivery of goods or services can be made for an non-forecasted sale.

Sales personnel are required to maintain a sales plan that establishes metrics that ensure the "work is done" to achieve their revenue targets. This plan should involve not only plans in terms of people, but also metrics that are to be tracked and managed in a tracking system. Metrics ensure that you understand what efforts your are undertaking to close the business. This tracking and plan should be visible and available for inspection and review by your management or any superiors in the company at any time.

#### Termination

Any employee or contractor terminated for reasons other than cause or misconduct will be provided their sales commissions on the regular sales commission schedule for recognized sales up to the date of termination.

Any employee terminated for cause will not be paid any commissions.

Commissions payable for recurring revenue will only be paid to the date of termination and will be prorated to the date of termination.

ULTIMATELY, IT IS UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE CEO, EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TEAM, AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH, IF ANY, COMMISSION PAYMENTS ARE MADE TO ANY INDIVIDUAL AT ANY TIME. BY ENGAGING IN AN EMPLOYEE OR CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THESE TERMS. **
