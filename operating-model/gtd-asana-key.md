**Context==Tag**  
  
Use tags for the contexts, i.e. the type of task or the context in which you need to get it done.  
We will be using standardized contexts across the organization:

* Online: Needs to be done online, using smartphone or computer
* Phone: It’s a phone call
* Office: This needs to be done at the LG office
* Errand: This needs to be run as an errand
* Home: This needs to be done at home
* Think: This is something that needs some thought, not immediate action
* Read: Something that requires reading
* Listen: Something that requires listening
* Bug: An problem that is customer impacting and that requires someone to fix it
* Frog: This is a big action, and will require concerted effort/time
* Focus:This requires a high level of focus, you might want to reserve your most alert/productive time for these tasks
* Avoiding: You know you have a habit/tendency to try and avoid tasks like this
* Easy: This can be easily and quickly done without much focus, might want to reserve these for if you have some brief time to get some quick things done
* Waiting: This is waiting on someone else to complete a task of their own first
* Maybe later: This is a good idea worth keeping, but now’s not the time for it, you’ll look at this context every once in a while and see if anything needs to be moved to more immediate
* High Pri: These are high priority tasks that needs immediate attention
* Stale: These are tags that are auto-marked by the GTD bot that haven't been touched in over 4 weeks.

**Project==Project**

**Duedate==Duedate**

**Timing==Newtasks,Today,UpcomingandLaterinAsana**

* New tasks: have not been sorted yet - This is your unprocessed inbox
* Today: This is where you'll sort tasks that you've decided in your morning sorting that you'll be doing today. Generally keep this list short and manageable to avoid overwhelm or blockage
* Upcoming: means that you will be getting to them soon, they are your next actions, and you'll be checking to see at the end of each day if you're going to move them to today
* Later: means they do not need your immediate attention. You will check on these in your monthly review to see if anything needs to be moved to upcoming or today.
*
