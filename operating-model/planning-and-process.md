## Planning and Process

These planning and process guidelines are defined to help us work together, better, while allowing everyone to work on their own, at their own pace.

### Planning

Story of size 1 - Tasks should be estimated at a size 1, the smallest atomic task that brings business value. These should typically be no more than 1 day of length. The rationale of this, is that 1\) everyone completes at least 1 activity every day, and 2\) things do not spiral out of control on relative weights, that's don't really matter. The additional side effect of this, is that there is no "70% done, boss" mentality. Everything is binary. It is done, or it is not.
