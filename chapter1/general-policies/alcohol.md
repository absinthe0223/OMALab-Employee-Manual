## Substance Policy

**It is the responsibility of every team member to ensure that their individual consumption is not making anyone else feel uncomfortable or unsafe.** Team members who violate this policy may face disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Alcohol in the form of beer or wine may occasionally be brought into the office to celebrate an accomplishment, birthday, or other milestone. Though events at the OMALAB office will be presumed dry until otherwise discussed, there may also be events in the office after work where beer or wine are available.+

Illegal drugs should not be used, bought, sold, or distributed while at work, either in the office or outside of the office while representing OMAlab.
