## Supplemental Policies for Client Engineering

At OMALab, Inc, we take the security of our client systems VERY seriously.  As such, these rules are designed to protect both our clients, as well as you, in the event there are problems.  

_**Login Credentials**_

* Before your engagement starts, you must be assigned a UNIQUE set of logins. These logins MUST be used by you at all times.
* You understand and acknowledge that all of your activities on client sites will be logged by systems installed on the sites. Any files you modify, create, read, or destroy will be logged.  
* You further understand that, should there ever be a problem with the security of your login credentials, such as added spyware/malware/viruses that are placed onto a client system using your credentials, you will be responsible for these activities. Cures for these activities will be any and/or all of the following:
  * Termination of you relationship wiht OMALab, Inc. 
  * Requested/demand of a refund for any/all of the fees paid to you for providing services to our clients.  
  * Reporting you to any third parties, that might result in the termination of your account on those third party systems.

_**Communications**_

* Slack
  * All communications in** \#channels** that are client specific are in the public.  The client can see these communications. So, please act at all times in a professional manner.
  * All direct message communications between you and a client must be copied to William Flanagan. No exceptions. This is done to ensure we have captured all issue, created tickets in Asana, and are tracking items to closure. 
  * If you have questions related to the task, please Direct Message William Flanagan or your current person that is/has assigned you the task.  
* Email
  * Any email exchanges between you and a client must be forwarded to William Flanagan or the person that has assigned you the task. No exceptions. 
* Asana
  * All clients have access to Asana and their projects. Ensure your communications with the clients are directly related to the task.  Do not add any extra items such as "I don't get this" or "I don't understand what to do." If you have questions about your task, Direct Message William Flanagan or your OMAlab Task assigner. Do not message the client to ask, unless expressly asked to do so by William.  
  * If you have questions about a task, ask William via Slack.  
  * Before you start the task, please update the estimate of the number of hours that the task will take. After you set this initial time, do not change it. William may have set a task estimate for you. If your estimate is HIGHER than William's, please change it to yours. If it's lower, then please leave William's estimate.  
  * When you start working on a task, change the status of the task from "New" to "In progress". This lets the client know that we have started on the task \(it sends them a message\).  
  * When you have the task ready and need feedback, change the status to "For Review" and assign to William for his review. Make sure you send a follow up message on Slack to let him know you have this completed.  
  * When the task is done, mark the item as DONE.  Add the actual amount of time your project took to complete.  

_**Billing and Time Keeping**_

* All billing must be done with Live screenshot timekeeping through Upwork or Hubstaff.  
* If you do not assign the time to a specific task, then you MUST add a note to the timekeeping stating what task you are performing. Timekeeping that does not have logs for what it is for will not be paid.
