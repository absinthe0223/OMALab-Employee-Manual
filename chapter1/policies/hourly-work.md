# Hourly-Paid Contractor Work Policy

> These policies apply if:
>
> * You are paid hourly
> * You are outside of the United States of America

These policies do not apply to hourly employees in the United States, which have laws and regulations related to hourly work.

You agree that your hourly wages are based on how productive you are, not for the hours you choose to bill us.

##### Not To Exceed Limit

You agree that your hours will be managed with a Not to Exceed \(NTE\) amount. This means that once you hit this cap, incremental work will not result in more payment.

If your Not to Exceed \(NTE\) is not explicitly set in a written agreement between you and the CEO, your billed work MUST not exceed 35 hours of your base rate per week, or 147 hours of your base rate monthly \(35 hours/week \* 4.2 weeks in a month\).
