# Operating Model

GTD is the basis for our work at OMAlab.  It's an operational model is a hybrid system built on Holacracy's tactical methodology, David Allen's [Getting Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com/), and using our own rules and agreements to make this come together in Asana. This section will provide you with all the information you need to navigate these systems.

 If this does not become the case eventually it is up to you to reach out for support.
