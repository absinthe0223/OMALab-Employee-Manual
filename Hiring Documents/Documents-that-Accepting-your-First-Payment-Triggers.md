While we attempt to get you to sign and accept the Guide as a guidebook for our working relationship--sometimes its difficult to get these documents back. Given this, you understand and acknowledge that by receiving a payment from OMALab, Inc. you are accepting the terms of this guidebook in its entirety, in all current and future versions.

Specifically, we strongly suggest you review the following contractual documents:

[Acknowledgement of Receipt and Acceptance](https://omalab.gitbooks.io/omalab-guide/content/Hiring-Documents/Acknowledgment-of-Receipt.html)- This is the document we request you sign and send back. If you don't, then accepting and depositing any payment from OMAlab, Inc. is considered acceptance of this agreement.

[Confidential Information, Invention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement](https://omalab.gitbooks.io/omalab-guide/content/Hiring-Documents/Partner-Proprietary-Information-and-Inventions-Assignment-Agreement.html)- This document is your actual employment agreement. It defines standard terms for your employment or contract. It also handles assignment of intellectual property created while being paid by OMALab, Inc.
