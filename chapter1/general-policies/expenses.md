## Expense Policy {#expense-policy}

* If it costs under $50 and it makes sense to you, just spend it.

  * No need to get approval. People need to get their work done and should feel empowered to spend under $50 to do so.
  * Bill it by going to the Google Doc expense form, copying it, filling it out, and sending it to Liz.

* If it costs more than $50, get approval from your direct supervisor or submit to Liz for approval.

* If it is a recurring expense then as long as it is under $120 per year then no need for approval.
