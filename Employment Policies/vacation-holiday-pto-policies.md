# Vacation, Holiday, and Paid Time Off \(PTO\) Policy {#vacation-holiday-and-paid-time-off-pto-policy}

Here are OMAlab, we’re working hard on creating a culture of personal responsibility and mutual trust, and we want our time off policy to reflect that. After some reflection, we decided to adopt an[**Open**](https://omalab.gitbooks.io/omalab-guide/content/GLOSSARY.html#open)**PTO Policy**which allows our employees the flexibility to take time off when they need it.[Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/)and other large employers have shown that this can work on a large scale, and it matches our culture perfectly.

We strongly feel that we’ll have better employee productivity and retention with this policy, but it’s not for everyone. It requires a strong peer review process and a lot of trust in your employees.

Here at OMAlab, we recognize the need for employees to take time away from the office to creatively recharge, and that not everyone works the best during traditional 9 to 5 office hours. We also believe in taking personal responsibility for managing our own time, workload and results. To that end, we’ve adopted an[Open](https://omalab.gitbooks.io/omalab-guide/content/GLOSSARY.html#open)PTO \(Paid Time Off\) policy, in which each employee is afforded the flexibility to take vacation, take time off for illness and shift schedules as necessary.

### **Who Qualifies** {#who-qualifies}

* The OMAlab[Open](https://omalab.gitbooks.io/omalab-guide/content/GLOSSARY.html#open)PTO plan is available to full-time, exempt \(salaried\) OMAlab employees.

* The OMAlab[Open](https://omalab.gitbooks.io/omalab-guide/content/GLOSSARY.html#open)PTO plan is available to international contactors that are on a fixed, monthly contract, and after two \(2\) months of completed work with the the company.

### **Our Policy** {#our-policy}

* We do not track or limit vacation times or sick days – take the time you need to operate at peak performance.

* You are welcome to shift their schedules to match your work style, as long as it does not impact the productivity of your colleagues, or your deliverable results.

* You do not “accrue” PTO days as in traditional plans, and so will not be compensated for “unused”PTO time when you leave the company.

### **Your Responsibilities** {#your-responsibilities}

* Keep your coworkers informed. Let your colleagues know at least**2 weeks ahead**of schedule when you’ll be on vacation, and report in on days you need to be out unexpectedly, before you miss the day. This includes holidays that are taken in your country--as your manager may be in a different country or operate on a different holiday schedule.

* Be available when you’re needed. Customer calls, staff meetings and other time sensitive responsibilities must be covered regardless of your personal work schedule. If you have planned time off, make sure to coordinate with your coworkers to have coverage for any of your responsibilities during that time off.

* Be productive. You are engaged by OMAlab with a role that has expectations and responsibilities, and are expected to maintain them.

* Don't let this policy interfere with the "norms" of your role. If your job is, for example, calling people that are reachable from 9am to 5pm, you should not adjust your schedule to a start time of 11am. There is NO WAY for this to not impact your productivity.

* Let your colleagues know when you will be taking time off for your country's schedule. For example, Independence Day, etc. at least 2 weeks in advance.
