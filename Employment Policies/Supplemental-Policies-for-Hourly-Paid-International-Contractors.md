# Supplemental Policies for Hourly-Paid International Contractors {#supplemental-policies-for-hourly-paid-international-contractors}

These policies apply if:

* You are paid hourly
* You are outside of the United States of America

These policies do not apply to hourly employees in the United States.

You agree that your hourly wages are based on how productive you are, not for the hours you choose to bill us.

You agree that your hours will managed with a Not to Exceed \(NTE\) amount. This means that once you hit this cap, incremental work will not result in more payment.

If your Not to Exceed \(NTE\) is not explicity set in a written agreement between you and the CEO, your not to exceed is 35 hours of your base rate per week, or 147 hours of your base rate monthly \(35 hours/week \* 4.2 weeks in a month\).
