## Standups and Meetings

Every company tries to balance the number of meetings \(which burn time\) with knowledge flow through the organization \(the bigger the flow the better\). No "ratio" is perfect, and will work for every situation.

Our set meeting schedule

Text-based, asynchronous standups

* Written on our chat in the \#standup channel accessible to everyone
* Focuses on readers
* Mostly for status updates
* Format

  * Yesterday
  * Today
  * Good things
  * Bad things
  * Challenges
  * Calls for help
  * Reminder about good practices
  * Code examples \(as links\)
  * Business-related information learned

One weekly project meeting

* Do not take time to update everyone on who is working, because we should know that from the \#dailyupdates and \#standups conversations
* Discuss problems, priorities, business domains, refactoring, knowledge crunching
* Generate a list of topics to discuss \(that don't have to be solved today\) for the upcoming week
* Recorded and can be played back

Topic-based meeting

* Scheduled for one topic
* Everyone builds a collective document that lays out concerns and opinions
* Meeting discusses the data in the document, and an opinon is formed
* Meeting is recorded and noted for the opinion
* The original requester of the topic updates the Wiki or Tasks with the decisions and the notes
